# Qilin-Med: Multi-stage Knowledge Injection Advanced Medical Large Language Model

> Qichen Ye, Junling Liu, Dading Chong, Peilin Zhou, Yining Hua, Andrew Liu

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Integrating large language models (LLMs) into healthcare presents potential but faces challenges. Directly pre-training LLMs for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and sometimes unfeasible. Sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domainspecific insights. Addressing these challenges, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). A notable contribution of our study
is the introduction of a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs,
and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, exhibits significant performance boosts.
